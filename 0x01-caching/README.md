What a Caching System Is
A caching system is a mechanism that temporarily stores copies of data or computation results in a fast-access storage (cache) to reduce the time and resources required to retrieve that data in the future. Caches are typically used to speed up access to frequently used data or to reduce the load on slower backend systems, like databases or web servers.

What FIFO Means
FIFO stands for First-In, First-Out. In the context of caching, it’s a policy that removes the oldest cached data (the one that was added first) when the cache becomes full and needs to make room for new data.

What LIFO Means
LIFO stands for Last-In, First-Out. It’s a policy that removes the most recently added data from the cache when the cache reaches its capacity and needs to store new data. It operates like a stack, where the last item added is the first to be removed.

What LRU Means
LRU stands for Least Recently Used. This caching policy removes the data that has not been accessed for the longest time. The idea is that data not used recently is less likely to be needed soon, so it can be safely evicted to free up space.

What MRU Means
MRU stands for Most Recently Used. This policy removes the most recently accessed data first. This can be useful in scenarios where the most recent data is expected to be less useful in the immediate future.

What LFU Means
LFU stands for Least Frequently Used. This policy evicts the data that has been accessed the least number of times. The assumption is that data with fewer accesses is less likely to be needed again soon.

The Purpose of a Caching System
The primary purpose of a caching system is to improve performance by reducing the time it takes to access frequently used data or to lower the load on slower or resource-intensive backend systems. By storing data closer to where it's needed (such as in memory rather than on disk or over a network), caches enable faster access to this data.

Benefits of a Caching System:

Speed: Faster access to data.
Efficiency: Reduced load on backend systems.
Scalability: Can help scale systems by reducing the frequency of expensive operations.
What Limits a Caching System Has
Caching systems have several limitations:

Cache Size: A cache has limited storage capacity. When it becomes full, older or less frequently used data must be evicted to make room for new data.

Staleness: Cached data may become outdated if the underlying data changes, leading to potential inconsistencies.

Eviction Policies: The effectiveness of a caching system depends on the chosen eviction policy (FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, LFU). If the wrong policy is chosen for the access pattern, it can lead to suboptimal performance.

Complexity: Implementing and managing a caching system can add complexity to a system, including the need to handle cache invalidation and ensure data consistency.

Overhead: Maintaining a cache incurs some overhead in terms of memory usage and the time taken to manage cache entries (insertion, eviction, etc.).

Despite these limitations, caching remains a crucial optimization technique in modern computing systems.
